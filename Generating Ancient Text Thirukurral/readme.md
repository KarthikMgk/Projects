<h3> Generating Ancient Text Thirukkural </h3>

<p> This is fun little project where I tried to generate new thirukkural text. Thirukkural is an ancient text written by sage thiruvalluvar The Tirukkural, or shortly the Kural, is a classic Tamil text consisting of 1,330 couplets or Kurals, dealing with the everyday virtues of an individual. It is one of the two oldest works now extant in Tamil literature in their entirety, the other being the Tolkappiyam.
