Lets revisit this Kaggle challenge and know more about solving it!

In this competition you will develop algorithms to classify genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text).

There are nine different classes a genetic mutation can be classified on.

This is not a trivial task since interpreting clinical evidence is very challenging even for human specialists. Therefore, modeling the clinical evidence (text) will be critical for the success of your approach

The data consists of gene, variation applied to that gene, clinical evidence in form of text and the resulting genetic mutation is the class label. Given, the gene, variation and clinical evidence, It must be classified into one of the nine classes. Iâ€™ve tried various Machine learning techniques along with several Feature engineering techniques to solve this problem
