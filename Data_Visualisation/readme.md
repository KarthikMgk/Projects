## Data Visualisation

Inorder to make the machine's learn the data, We must first learn it!! This process in short is called the data visualisation. Data visualisation shows the non-alphanumerical face of the data. We often see the numerical or alphanumerical form of data which human brain cannot understand. By visualising the data, We can understand the hidden patterns, underlying condition and how each of our explanatory variable behave in context of other explanatory variables in our data

In the project, We will be visualising the famous Haberman cancer survival dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/gilsousa/habermans-survival-data-set). Let's begin!!!
